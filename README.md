# easy-async
An easy way to produce and consumes messages

It is a NodeJS package to work with third-party async producers and consumers (the consumer part is not implemented yet).
The goal of this project is to give a nice fluent API to work with many different providers, like `Kafka` and/or `RabbitMQ` for example.

It's in WIP for now, I pretend to create the first release in the next few weeks.
